Iris Flower Classification
A simple yet powerful **Machine Learning project** that classifies Iris flowers into three species — **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** — using petal and sepal measurements.

📊 Overview
This project uses the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with 4 features each:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
The goal is to predict the flower species based on these measurements.

Concepts Covered
- Data preprocessing and label encoding  
- Train-test splitting  
- Model training using `RandomForestClassifier`  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Visualisation of feature relationships and importance  

Libraries used
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
